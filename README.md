## 🔍 SEO Implementation

### Dynamic Routes

```text
/tools/[slug]
```

Examples:

/tools/bioglow
/tools/tapnest
/tools/linkloom
```

---

### SEO Metadata

Every page contains unique:

- Title Tag
- Meta Description
- Canonical URL
- Open Graph Metadata
- Twitter Card Metadata

---

### Structured Data

Implemented using:

```json
{
	"@context": "https://schema.org",
	"@type": "SoftwareApplication"
}
```

The dataset represents software products, making `SoftwareApplication` the most appropriate schema type.

---

### Sitemap

Automatically generated from all tool routes.

Example:

```text
/sitemap.xml
```

---

### Robots

Search engine crawling configuration:

```text
/robots.txt
```

---

## ⚙️ Rendering Strategy

### Why SSG?

The provided dataset is static and contains a fixed number of records.

Static Site Generation was selected because it provides:

- Better SEO performance
- Faster page load times
- Reduced server workload
- Fully pre-rendered pages for search engine crawlers
- Improved Core Web Vitals

All tool detail pages are generated at build time.
